## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Lecture 1 - In class demonstration & problems

In this demonstration, we will explore a simple dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/laurae2/data-scientists-vs-size-of-datasets/downloads/data-scientists-vs-size-of-datasets.zip/1

This research study was conducted to analyze the (potential) relationship between hardware and data set sizes. 100 data scientists from France between Jan-2016 and Aug-2016 were interviewed in order to have exploitable data. Therefore, this sample might not be representative of the true population.

For the data, it uses the following fields (DS = Data Scientist, W = Workstation):

DS_1 = Are you working with "large" data sets at work? (large = over 1 billion values) => Yes or No<br />
DS_2 = Do you enjoy working with large data sets? => Yes or No<br />
DS_3 = Would you rather have small, medium, or large data sets for work? => Small, Medium, or Large<br />
DS_4 = Do you have any presence at Kaggle or any other Data Science platforms? => Yes or No<br />
DS_5 = Do you view yourself proficient at working in Data Science? => Yes, A bit, or No<br />
W_1 = What is your CPU brand? => Intel or AMD<br />
W_2 = Do you have access to a remote server to perform large workloads? => Yes or No<br />
W_3 = How much Euros would you invest in Data Science brand new hardware? => numeric output, rounded by 100s<br />
W_4 = How many cores do you have to work with data sets? => numeric output<br />
W_5 = How much RAM (in GB) do you have to work with data sets? => numeric output<br />
W_6 = Do you do GPU computing? => Yes or No <br />
W_7 = What programming languages do you use for Data Science? => R or Python (any other answer accepted) <br />
W_8 = What programming languages do you use for pure statistical analysis? => R or Python (any other answer accepted) <br />
W_9 = What programming languages do you use for training models? => R or Python (any other answer accepted) <br />
```{r}
#setwd("mydirectory")
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Public/machine_learning/Biomedical_data_explore/data/data_scientist_survey.csv",
         header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
data
```

## In Class Practice Questions

Q1: What percent of the data scientists surveyed here use Intel brand CPUs?
```{r}
(nrow(data[data$W_1=="Intel",])/nrow(data))*100
```

Q2: In the self-evaluation of proficiency, which of the possible classes in the data library is not represented in the actual data?
```{r}
levels(data$DS_5)
#Answer= "A bit"
```

Q3: What is the median number of cores that the Data Scientists have to work with?
```{r}
summary(data)
#Answer=2
```

Q4: What percent of data scientsts in the US work with "large" datasets?
```{r}
#This data is for data scientists from France, so not applicable.
```

## Let's visualize the data

```{r}
#new plots learned include floating bar plots, waterfall plots etc
```
